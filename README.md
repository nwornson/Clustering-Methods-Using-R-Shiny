# Clustering-Methods-Using-R-Shiny
Work in progress.  I want to explore different unsupervised clustering methods, and I would like to create an interactive shiny application.  Run the following line of code in an interactive R session to launch the app:

library(shiny)

runGitHub('Clustering-Methods-Using-R-Shiny','nwornson')
